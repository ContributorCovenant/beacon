# Beacon

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/ContributorCovenant/beacon.svg?branch=release)](https://travis-ci.com/ContributorCovenant/beacon)

## Background

Over the past several years, code of conduct adoptions by open source projects have become the norm for open source project. However, enforcement of a code of conduct is the real key to creating welcoming and inclusive community comprising a diverse set of participants.

But up to now, only the largest open source projects have had access to the kinds of resources that make enforcement even possible, let alone fair and manageable.

Beacon was created with the goal of bringing this potential to every open source project, large or small. It gives project maintainers a complete set of tools for managing their communities: setting up their enforcement teams, documenting their processes, managing code of conduct issues, forming consensus around enforcement decisions, and communicating clearly and fairly with reporters and respondents.

Beacon will be provided in a software-as-a-service (SaaS) model to reduce friction for getting started, so that maintainers can focus on managing their projects and communities with a minimum of setup.
