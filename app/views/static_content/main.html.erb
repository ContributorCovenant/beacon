<h1>Welcome to Beacon</h1>

<p>Over the past several years, code of conduct adoptions by open source projects has become the norm for establishing and communicating community values. However, enforcement of a code of conduct is the real key to creating welcoming and inclusive communities.</p>

<p>But up to now, only the largest open source projects have had access to the kinds of resources that make enforcement even possible, let alone fair and manageable.</p>

<p>Beacon is a resource designed to bring this potential to every open source project, large or small. Beacon provides project maintainers with a complete set of tools for managing their codes of conduct at all stages: setting up your enforcement teams, documenting your processes, reporting incidents, managing incident reports, building consensus around enforcement decisions, and communicating clearly with reporters and offenders.</p>
