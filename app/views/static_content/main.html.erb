<h1>Welcome to Beacon</h1>

<p>Over the past several years, code of conduct adoptions by events and open source projects has become the norm for establishing and communicating community values. However, enforcement of a code of conduct is the real key to creating welcoming and inclusive communities. But until now, only the largest organizations have had access to the kinds of resources that make enforcement even possible, let alone fair and manageable.</p>

<h2>Safety. Transparency. Consistency.</h2>

<p>Beacon is a resource designed to bring this potential to every event and open source project, large or small. Beacon provides a complete set of tools for managing your code of conduct at all stages: setting up your enforcement teams, documenting your processes, reporting incidents, managing incident reports, building consensus around enforcement decisions, and communicating clearly with reporters and respondents. Beacon brings <b>safety, transparency, and consistency</b> to community management in open source.</p>
